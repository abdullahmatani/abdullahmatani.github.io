The primary use of Draw Bowties is a fast and accessible way of generating bowties for hazard analysis. It has several options for customising the displays such as barrier colors, line colors and thicknessess. The files can be saved locally to JSON or exported to PDF for use in reports.

This webtool was created using Flutter and a number of plugins, mainly the following:

1. infinite_canvas
2. printing (pdf export)

There is currently no backend support for this web-application. All work can be saved as JSON and loaded whenever the application is loaded again.
